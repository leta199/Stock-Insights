# Stock-Tracker-
A neat, little project to learn more about graphing in Python to help track stock prices and discover trends over time across various stocks. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In time as I grow better in Python, I wish to implement machine learning models to predict future stock prices to help in investment decisons. 
This would be very useful in the following fields: 

1) Finance and invetsment- quantitaive strategies to increase rerurn on onvestment.
2) Corporate finance- understanding market sentiment.
3) Goveernance and policy- allows regulatory bodies to keep track of the best performing companies and implement lasws to sterngthen industry.
4) Economic research- in event studeis to realise how stock prices are affetced by news and events and predict how future evenst will affect stocks.
